This webpage contains material and references for the [ESSLLI2024](https://2024.esslli.eu/) advanced course Proof Theory of Modal Logic. The course will take place in Week 2 (5-9 August 2024) and consists of five 90-minutes lectures. As course material, we use the slides of the lectures and, possibly, some handouts. The slides of each lecture will contain some exercises that you are encouraged to try to solve!

## Prerequisites <a name="pre"></a>
We only assume some basic familiarity with sequent calculus and modal logics. We will briefly introduce both topics, recalling the main notions used throughout the course, in Lecture 1. To learn more about sequent calculus and proof theory, you can attend the introductory course Linear Logic, which will also take place in Week 2 of ESSLLI24.

There are several textbooks and resources that introduce modal logics. You could have a look at one of the following:
